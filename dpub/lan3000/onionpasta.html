 <p>
1.  Cook pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 11/2 cups pasta water.
 <p>

   <p>
2. Meanwhile, heat a large ovenproof frying pan over medium-high heat. Working with one sausage at a time, squeeze meat from casing and shape into rough balls. Spray with oil and fry for 8 minutes, turning frequently, or until golden and cooked through. Stir soup mix with reserved pasta water until dissolved. Add soup mixture and pasta to pan with meatballs and stir well to coat. Bring to the boil.
 <p>

   <p>
3.  Preheat grill on high. Scatter cheese over meatballs and pasta, season with pepper, and grill for 5 minutes or until cheese melts. Serve.
